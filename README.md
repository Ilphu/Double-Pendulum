Major inspo for this project comes form Joe Liang, highly recommend you go check out his stuff. This is ensentially the same thing as what he did however written in C++. All of the code not in the `stbi` files is mine, I intentionally didn't look at his repo. I also got insporoation from many others who have doen similar things to, MIT, and many youtube videos are what inspired me.
